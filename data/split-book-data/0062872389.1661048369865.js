window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Author of the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> and international best-seller </b><b><i>Unfu*k Yourself</i></b><b> Gary John Bishop presents a no-holds-barred guide to breaking through our cycles of self-sabotage to get what we want out of life. </b></p> <p>In <i>Unfu*k Yourself</i>, Gary John Bishop told us it was time to stop making excuses - to recognize and take responsibility for the negative self-talk holding us back. In <i>Stop Doing That Sh*t</i>, he builds on that message, teaching us how to stop self-sabotaging behavior.&nbsp;</p> <p>Bishop explains how our destructive cycles come down to the way we’re wired. He then identifies different types of people and the ways we f--k ourselves over: We can’t save money. We land in the same type of toxic relationship. We’re stuck in a rut at work. Analyzing why we act the way we do, including what our common grenades are that blow up our lives, Bishop then shows how we can interrupt the cycle and stop self-sabotaging our lives.&nbsp;</p> <p>Authored in the same in-your-face style as <i>Unfu*k Yourself</i>,<i> Stop Doing That Sh*t</i> will help us get in touch with our psychological machinery so we learn to interrupt negative thoughts and behavior before they start, allowing us to give our attention to something else, and start to find success in the areas we thought we never could.&nbsp;</p> <p>We can take back our lives. We may have f--ked up in the past, but <i>Stop Doing That Sh*t</i> will show us how to break the patterns in order to live the lives we yearn to have.</p>";
