window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>For the first time, Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson opens up about his amazing comeback - from tragic personal loss to thriving businessman and cableâ€™s highest-paid executive - in this unique self-help guide, his first since his blockbuster </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller </b><b><i>The 50th Law</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>In his early 20s, Curtis Jackson, known as 50 Cent, rose to the heights of fame and power in the cutthroat music business. A decade ago, the multi-platinum selling rap artist decided to pivot. His ability to adapt to change was demonstrated when he became the executive producer and star of <i>Power</i>, a high-octane, gripping crime drama centered around a drug kingpin's family. The series quickly became \"appointment\" television, leading to Jackson inking a four-year, $150 million contract with the Starz network - the most lucrative deal in premium cable history.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, in his most personal audiobook, Jackson shakes up the self-help category with his unique, cutting-edge lessons and hard-earned advice on embracing change. Where <i>The 50th Law</i> tells listeners, \"Fear nothing and you shall succeed\", <i>Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter</i> builds on this message, combining it with Jackson's street smarts and hard-learned corporate savvy to help listeners successfully achieve their own comeback - and to learn to flow with the changes that disrupt their own lives.</p>";
