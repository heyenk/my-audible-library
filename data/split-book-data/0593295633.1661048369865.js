window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Eckhart Tolle highlights the most inspiring and beautiful insights of </b><b><i>A New Earth</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>When Oprah announced <i>A New Earth</i> as her 61st Book Club selection, it skyrocketed to number one on the <i>New York Times</i> best seller list, selling over five million copies in paperback and remaining at the top of the list for 22 consecutive weeks. In <i>A New Earth</i>, renowned spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle describes how our current ego-based state of consciousness operates. The purpose of this book is to bring about a shift in consciousness, or in his words, an awakening. An essential part of this awakening is the recognition of the ego, and our attachment to things, the past, and enemies.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Oneness with All Life</i>, Eckhart Tolle has picked the essential phrases and paragraphs - the gems of the book -that he feels are most important and reorganized them so listeners can focus on the most powerful ideas. It is the perfect gift for anyone with a well-worn copy of <i>A New Earth</i> who wants deeper insight into this seminal work.&nbsp;</p>";
