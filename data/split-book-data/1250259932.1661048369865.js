window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This program is read by the author.</b></p> <p><b>The ultimate guide on leadership from the number-one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling coauthor of </b><b><i>Extreme Ownership</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>In the military, a field manual provides instructions in simple, clear, step-by-step language to help soldiers complete their mission. In the civilian sector, books offer information on everything from fixing a leaky faucet to developing an effective workout program to cooking a good steak.</p> <p>But what if you are promoted into a new position leading your former peers? What if you don’t get selected for the leadership position you wanted? How do you overcome imposter syndrome when you aren’t sure you should be leading? As a leader, how do you judiciously dole out punishment? What about reward? How do you build trust with your both your superiors and your subordinates? How do you deliver truthful criticism up and down the chain of command in a tactful and positive way?</p> <p>These are all questions about leadership - the most complex of all human endeavors. And while there are books out there that provide solid leadership principles, books like <i>Extreme Ownership </i>and <i>The Dichotomy of Leadership</i>, there is no leadership field manual that provides a direct, situational, pragmatic how-to guide that anyone can instantly put to use.</p> <p>Until now. <i>Leadership Strategy and Tactics</i> explains how to take leadership theory, quickly translate that theory into applicable strategy, and then put leadership into action at a tactical level. This audiobook is the solution that leaders at every level need - not just to understand the leadership game but also how to play the leadership game and win it.</p>";
