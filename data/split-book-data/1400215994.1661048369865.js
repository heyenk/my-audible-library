window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A blunt wake-up call to salespeople and sales leaders that debunks the myths of the latest miracle solutions and refocuses your sales strategy on a proven approach that will drive the results you want. </b></p> <p>Can you handle the truth? Can succeeding in sales be as simple as hooking up the latest CRM tool or perfecting your social media profiles and waiting for qualified leads to automatically show up in your inbox? Are you having trouble believing what the new self-proclaimed “experts” keep posting on LinkedIn and beginning to question their proclamation that&nbsp;<i>everything&nbsp;</i>in sales has changed?&nbsp;</p> <p>Welcome to the world of sales, where the one constant you can bank on is the noise from so-called experts and thought leaders who want to convince you everything has changed and that you need their latest tools, toys, or tricks to stay even or get ahead of the pack. Yet, ironically, it seems that the more of these new miracle solutions you adopt, the harder it is to get results.&nbsp;</p> <p>In&nbsp;<i>Sales Truth</i>, Mike Weinberg offers a blunt wake-up call to salespeople and sales leaders on how to get past the noise and nonsense, so you can start winning more new sales. Here’s the truth:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Many of these so-called sales experts lack clients, credibility, and a track record of helping sellers achieve breakthrough results.&nbsp;</li> <li>The number of “likes” a sales improvement article receives is often inversely proportional to its accuracy or helpfulness to the typical seller or sales team.&nbsp;</li> <li>What has worked exceedingly well in sales and sales management for the past couple of decades is still the (not so) secret to sales success today, and you can discover these accessible, simple truths and best practices that will drive the results you want in this bold new book.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Mike Weinberg, best-selling author of&nbsp;<i>New Sales. Simplified. </i>and&nbsp;<i>Sales Management. Simplified.</i>,&nbsp;brings sanity back to the sales effectiveness table by sharing proven strategies that he sees working firsthand across sales teams in a myriad of industries around the globe. Stop looking for the shortcut or secret sales sauce and instead apply Weinberg’s proven, powerful principles to help you master the fundamentals of professional selling and create more new sales opportunities than you ever believed possible.</p>";
