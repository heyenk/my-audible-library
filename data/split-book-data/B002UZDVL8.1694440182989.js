window.bookSummaryJSON = "This long-awaited second book by renowned spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle goes deeper into the teachings so eloquently and clearly expressed in his first book, <i>The Power of Now</i>. <p>These short, clear entries are organized into ten topic clusters ranging from \"Stillness and Silence\" and \"Beyond the Thinking Mind\" to \"Relationships\" and \"Suffering and the End of Suffering.\" Whether listened to individually or in topic clusters, these entries take on a rare transformative power.</p> <p>While its message is broad and profound, <i>Stillness Speaks</i> is also highly practical. Eckhart Tolle shows us how to be with another in a relationship that can contain and weather all things, how to sit with a dying person, where to find wisdom, how to free ourselves of guilt, and how to control our constant stream of thoughts. Underneath the words, and in the spaces between them, we find the power of stillness, a vibrantly alive state existing only in the present moment. <i>Stillness Speaks</i> draws upon the essence of all spiritual traditions, offering a message that is both ancient and contemporary, filled with timely and powerful wisdom.</p>";
