window.bookSummaryJSON = "Marcus Aurelius was Roman Emperor from 161 C.E. to his death in 180 C.E. He was destined to be a leader, having beeen born into a prominent family - one related by blood and marriage to rulers and bankers. During his era, Romans who inherited power and vast fortunes were expected to set an example. <p> Marcus shouldered his responsibilities with a clear sense of honor. He was history's first ombudsman, and if his role as a legislator or conqueror was not great, he did set high standards for emulation. Written in the form of confessions, his meditations provide a window into his insights on duty, virtue, and humility. He was the last of the \"Five Good Emperors\", and is also considered one of the most important stoic philosophers.</p> <p> <i>The Meditations</i>, written on campaign between 170 and 180 C.E., is still revered as a literary monument to a government of service and duty, and it has been praised for its \"exquisite accent and its infinite tenderness\". In fact, John Stuart Mill, in his <i>Utility of Religion</i>, compared <i>The Meditations</i> to the \"Sermon on the Mount\".</p>";
