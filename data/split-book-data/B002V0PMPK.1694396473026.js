window.bookSummaryJSON = "The classic best seller by Benjamin Graham, perhaps the greatest investment advisor of the 20th century, <i>The Intelligent Investor</i> has taught and inspired hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Since its original publication in 1949, Benjamin Graham's book has remained the most respected guide to investing, due to his timeless philosophy of \"value investing\", which helps protect investors against areas of (possible) substantial error and teaches them to develop long-term strategies which they will be comfortable with down the road. <p>Among this audiobook's special features are the use of numerous comparisons of pairs of common stocks to bring out their elements of strength and weakness and the construction of investment portfolios designed to meet specific requirements of quality and price attractiveness.</p>";
