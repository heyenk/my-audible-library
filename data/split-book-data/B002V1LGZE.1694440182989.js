window.bookSummaryJSON = "In this audio edition of the totally revised underground best seller, <i>The E-Myth</i>, Michael Gerber dispels the myths surrounding starting your own business and shows how commonplace assumptions can get in the way of running a business. He walks you through the steps in the life of a business, from entrepreneurial infancy, through adolescent growing pains, to the mature entrepreneurial perspective, the guiding light of all businesses that succeed, and shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business, whether or not it is a franchise. Finally, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working on your business and working in your business. After you have listened to <i>The E-Myth Revisited</i>, you will truly be able to grow your business in a predictable and productive way.";
