window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Prentice Mulford was a New Age thinker long before the term was coined. In the 1880s he foresaw the Internet, world-wide air travel and many other future realities. In this work we have taken many of the concepts from his various books and put them into one book. His unique and direct style allows for our exploration of the most perplexing aspects of what it means to be a spiritual entity living with and through a material body. This is the owners manual for the human condition.</p>";
