window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Astral projection occurs when you consciously separate your soul or astral body from your physical body. Your consciousness goes with the astral body. The difference between this and an out-of body experience is that astral projection leaves the body with a conscious intent and can last as long as you want it to. When you astral travel, your body is left behind in the physical world, functioning as normally as it would otherwise. A silver cord (which attaches your physical body to the astral body) keeps you connected. At the point of death, the silver cord is severed, you die and your soul continues to its next destination. </p> <p>Astral projection is not the same as dreaming. Everything appears to be in real life and real time - that is, you are in your room or wherever you lay down to do it. </p> <p>Any beings you encounter are also real and simply living on the astral plane, as opposed to the earthly prime material plane, as itâ€™s called. There are so many things to do or experience while astral projecting, including: </p> <ul> <li>Accelerated spiritual growth </li> <li>Finding peace of mind, knowing there is more to life than most assume </li> <li>Improved psychic powers and awareness </li> <li>Super-effective problem solving </li> <li>Encountering lucid dream architecture, ie, experiencing dreams as you never have before </li> <li>Travelling and exploring the universe </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>In <i>Astral Projection</i>, featuring hypnosis-induced astral travel techniques, number-one best-selling spiritual author Craig Beck reveals the secrets behind achieving possibly the most profound events of your life.</p>";
