window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The <i>Text</i> is Book 1 of 4 (three books and one supplement) of the A Course in Miracles series. <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, also known as \"the Course\" or ACIM, was scribed by Dr. Helen Schucman. It is a self-study course that aims to assist listeners, readers, and students in achieving spiritual transformation. ACIM presents a purely non-dualistic philosophy of forgiveness and includes practical lessons and applications for the practice of forgiveness in one's daily life. </p> <p>As its title implies, <i>A Course in Miracles</i> is arranged throughout as a teaching device. It consists of three books: <i>Text, Workbook for Students,</i> and <i>Manual for Teachers.</i> The order in which students choose to use the books, and the ways in which they study them, depends on their particular needs and preferences. Two supplements to the Course: \"Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, Practice\" and \"The Song of Prayer\", are also included as part of ACIM. </p> <p>The curriculum the Course presents is carefully conceived and is explained, step by step, at both the theoretical and practical levels. It emphasizes application rather than theory, and experience rather than theology. Although Christian in statement, the Course deals with universal spiritual themes. It emphasizes that it is but one version of the universal curriculum. There are many others, this one differing from them only in form. They all lead to God in the end. </p> <p>Book 1: <i>Text</i> is largely theoretical, and sets forth the concepts on which the Course's thought system is based. Its ideas contain the foundation for the lessons in Book 2, the <i>Workbook for Students.</i> Without the practical application the <i>Workbook</i> provides, the <i>Text</i> would remain largely a series of abstractions which would hardly suffice to bring about the thought reversal at which the Course aims. </p> <p>Book 2: <i>Workbook for Students</i> includes 365 lessons, one for each day of the year. It is not necessary, however, to do the lessons at that tempo, and one might want to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day. The practical nature of the <i>Workbook</i> is underscored by the introduction to its lessons, which emphasizes experience through application rather than a prior commitment to a spiritual goal. Some of the ideas the <i>Workbook</i> presents you will find hard to believe, and others may seem to be quite startling. This does not matter. You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you are directed to do. You are not asked to judge them at all. You are asked only to use them. It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true. </p> <p>Book 3: <i>Manual for Teachers</i> is written in question and answer form, and provides answers to some of the more likely questions a student might ask. It also includes a clarification of a number of the terms the Course uses, explaining them within the theoretical framework of the <i>Text</i>. The Course makes no claim to finality, nor are the lessons in its <i>Workbook</i> intended to bring the student's learning to completion. At the end, the reader is left in the hands of his or her own Internal Teacher, Who will direct all subsequent learning as He sees fit. </p> <p></p> <p>Supplements to ACIM, \"Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, Practice\" and \"The Song of Prayer\", were scribed by Dr. Helen Schucman, as was <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, and are extensions of its principles.</p>";
