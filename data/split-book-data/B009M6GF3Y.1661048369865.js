window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Over a decade ago came the <i>Hypnotic Salesman:</i> seven key principles of subliminal communication that teach anyone to sell directly to the subconscious, bypassing the part of the mind responsible for judging and evaluating.

Willpower and even a stubborn personality are no defence against these amazing but easy-to-learn techniques. What you will discover in this book will potentially change and improve your interaction with everyone in your life. Not just with sales prospects but with your friends, family, and partners too. People have used these techniques to blast their targets, improve their careers, understand their children better, and even find and attract the man or woman of their dreams.</p>";
