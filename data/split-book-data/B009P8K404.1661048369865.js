window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant</i> is a guide to financial freedom. It’s the second book in the Rich Dad Series and reveals how some people work less, earn more, pay less in taxes, and learn to become financially free.</p> <p><i>CASHFLOW Quadrant</i> was written for those who are ready to move beyond job security and enter the world of financial freedom. It’s for those who want to make significant changes in their lives and take control of their financial future.</p> <p>Robert believes that the reason most people struggle financially is because they've spent years in school but were never taught about money. Robert’s rich dad taught him that this lack of financial education is why so many people work so hard all their lives for money...instead of learning how to make money work for them.</p> <p>This book will change the way you think about jobs, careers, and owning your own business and inspire you to learn the rules of money that the rich use to build and grow their wealth.</p>";
