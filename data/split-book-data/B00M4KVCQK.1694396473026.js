window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This work of speculative nonfiction combines meticulous fact-finding from historian/researcher Richard M. Dolan and forward-leaning scenarios from journalist/screenwriter Bryce Zabel on the world's most mind-bending subject. The authors predict radical changes after official acknowledgment that at least some UFOs are intelligently controlled craft from somewhere other than Earth. <i>A.D. After Disclosure</i> isn't afraid to make mind-blowing, specific predictions, such as: Congress will hold Watergate-style hearings and ask secret-keepers, \"What did you know and when did you know it? \"The first decade A.D. (After Disclosure) will be like a high-tech 1960s, spawning massive cultural and societal change. Abductees will file a class-action suit against the government for withholding critical information. All the textbooks on planet Earth - from history to science - will need an immediate review. Whether disclosure leads to social panic or ushers in a new era of unity and peace, it will undoubtedly be a game-changing event.</p>";
