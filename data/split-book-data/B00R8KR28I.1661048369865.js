window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The author of the blockbuster <i>New York Times</i> best sellers <i>The Happiness Project</i> and <i>Happier at Home</i> tackles the critical question: How do we change? </p> <p>Gretchen Rubin's answer: through <i>habits</i>. Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life. It takes work to make a habit, but once that habit is set, we can harness the energy of habits to build happier, stronger, more productive lives. </p> <p>So if habits are a key to change, then what we really need to know is: How do we change our habits? </p> <p><i>Better Than Before</i> answers that question. It presents a practical, concrete framework to allow listeners to understand their habits - and to change them for good. Infused with Rubin's compelling voice, rigorous research, and easy humor, and packed with vivid stories of lives transformed, <i>Better Than Before</i> explains the (sometimes counterintuitive) core principles of habit formation. </p> <p>Along the way Rubin uses herself as guinea pig, tests her theories on family and friends, and answers listeners' most pressing questions - oddly, questions that other writers and researchers tend to ignore: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Why do I find it tough to create a habit for something I love to do? </li> <li>Sometimes I can change a habit overnight, and sometimes I can't change a habit no matter how hard I try. Why? </li> <li>How quickly can I change a habit? </li> <li>What can I do to make sure I stick to a new habit? </li> <li>How can I help someone else change a habit? </li> <li>Why can I keep habits that benefit others but can't make habits that are just for me? </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Whether listeners want to get more sleep, stop checking their devices, maintain a healthy weight, or finish an important project, habits make change possible. Listening to just a few chapters of <i>Better Than Before</i> will make listeners eager to start work on their own habits - even before they've finished the audiobook. </p> <p>Bonus feature: includes a full episode from the author's podcast <i>Happier with Gretchen Rubin</i> in which she discusses how to build happier habits into everyday life. </p>";
