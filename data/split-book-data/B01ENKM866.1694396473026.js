However, many of us are unable to because we are blinded by modern misconceptions of parenting and our own inner limitations. In <i>The Awakened Family</i>, I show you how you can cultivate a relationship with your children so they can thrive; moreover, you can be transformed to a state of greater calm, compassion, and wisdom as well. </p> <p>This book will take you on a journey to transcending your fears and illusions around parenting and help you become the parent you always wanted to be: fully present and conscious. It will arm you with practical, hands-on strategies and real-life examples from my experience as a parent and clinical psychologist that show the extraordinary power of being a conscious parent. </p> <p>Everyone in your family is ready to be awakened. </p> <p>Will you take this journey with me? </p> <p>- Shefali </p>";
