window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Caution: This book can help make you wealthy and happy or, depending on your situation, wealthier and happier. But only if you approach it with an open mind. </p> <p>Start with this thought: Your success in your professional, financial, and personal lives depends to a great extent on your ability to articulate. </p> <p>Throughout recorded history, many thinkers have noted the importance of being articulate and the power of words; you'll find a few of their comments in the book. Pete, however, goes a giant step further by connecting articulation to wealth and happiness and to the clear thinking and better decisions that thwart mediocrity. He quite correctly points out that we think in words, and we need more words to think with as the issues we need to resolve become more complex, as they do when we rise in any organization and when our close relationships mature. </p> <p>Pete has successfully and clearly connected wealth, happiness, and words with compelling evidence. Now you can make the same connections, and you can follow his succinct guidelines and become a true Articulate. </p> <p>This book isn't a cure-all for those who are dissatisfied with their professional, financial, and personal lives. No book is. But this a good start. </p>";
