window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>How do you inspire a diverse team to work together, going all out in pursuit of a single, challenging goal? How do you get your team to commit to bold goals? How do you stay motivated despite setbacks and disappointments? And what do you do when it looks like you're headed for failure? In <i>Radical Focus</i>, Christina Wodtke combines her hard earned experience as an executive at Zynga, Linkedin and many of Silicon Valley's hottest companies to answer those questions. It's not about to-do lists and accountability charts. It's about creating a framework for regular check-ins, key results, and most of all, the beauty of a good fail - and how to take a temporary disaster and turn it into a future success.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this book, Wodtke takes you through the fictional case study of Hanna and Jack, who are struggling to survive in their own startup. They fight shiny object syndrome, losing focus, and dealing with communication issues. After hard lessons, they learn the practical steps they need to take to do what must be done. The second half of the book demonstrates how to use objectives and key results (OKRs) to help teams realize big goals in a methodical way, leaving nothing to chance. Laid out in a practical but compelling way, she makes the lessons of Hanna and Jack's story clear and actionable.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ready to move your team in the right direction? Listen to this, and learn the system of creating your focus - and finding success.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
