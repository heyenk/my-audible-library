window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When you have taken this class, you will understand the similarities and differences between traditional product management and scrum product ownership. In order to develop a product from original concept to working model, many factors must be taken into consideration. Clients and stakeholders might have a clear idea of what they want and when they want it. In such cases, it is the product owner's responsibility to clarify all of the details and enable the development team to generate the final product as quickly and inexpensively as possible. If the client and stakeholders are not as certain about what it is that they want, the product owner has the added responsibility of helping them to figure out what they want and articulating this to the developers. In each segment of a development project the roles and responsibilities of product managers and product owners differ substantially. In each class, we will examine a component of product development and identify the different ways that these two roles approach them. In this class you will learn: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>An overview of the two product development methods </li> <li>How to manage requirements as a product owner as opposed to a traditional product manager </li> <li>How to plan a project as a product owner versus a traditional product manager </li> <li>How to schedule a project as a product owner as opposed to a traditional product manager </li> <li>Common methods for budgeting a project as a product owner versus that of a traditional product manager </li> <li>Tips for becoming a product owner in your team or business </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Now, let us move forward and let me help you to learn the differences between a traditional product manager and a scrum product owner. </p>";
