window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this groundbreaking analysis of personality type, best-selling author of</b> <b><i>Better Than Before</i></b> <b>and</b> <b><i>The Happiness Project</i></b> <b>Gretchen Rubin reveals the one simple question that will transform what you do at home, at work, and in life.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>During her multi-book investigation into understanding human nature, Gretchen Rubin realized that by asking the seemingly dry question “How do I respond to expectations?” we gain explosive self-knowledge. She discovered that based on their answer, people fit into Four Tendencies: Upholders, Questioners, Obligers, and Rebels. Our Tendency shapes every aspect of our behavior, so using this framework allows us to make better decisions, meet deadlines, suffer less stress, and engage more effectively.</p> <p>More than 600,000 people have taken her online quiz, and managers, doctors, teachers, spouses, and parents already use the framework to help people make significant, lasting change.</p> <p>The Four Tendencies hold practical answers if you’ve ever thought:</p> <ul> <li>People can rely on me, but I can’t rely on myself.</li> <li>How can I help someone to follow good advice?</li> <li>People say I ask too many questions.</li> <li>How do I work with someone who refuses to do what I ask - or who keeps telling me what to <i>do</i>?</li> </ul> <p>With sharp insight, compelling research, and hilarious examples, <i>The Four Tendencies</i> will help you get happier, healthier, more productive, and more creative. It’s far easier to succeed when you know what works for you.</p>";
