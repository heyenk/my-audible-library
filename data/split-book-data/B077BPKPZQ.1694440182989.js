window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best seller</p> <p>The author of <i>The Talent Code</i> unlocks the secrets of highly successful groups and provides tomorrow’s leaders with the tools to build a cohesive, motivated culture.</p> <p>Named one of the best books of the year by <i>Bloomberg</i> and <i>Library Journal </i></p> <p>Where does great culture come from? How do you build and sustain it in your group, or strengthen a culture that needs fixing? In <i>The Culture Code</i>, Daniel Coyle goes inside some of the world’s most successful organizations - including the US Navy’s SEAL Team Six, IDEO, and the San Antonio Spurs - and reveals what makes them tick. He demystifies the culture-building process by identifying three key skills that generate cohesion and cooperation, and explains how diverse groups learn to function with a single mind. Drawing on examples that range from Internet retailer Zappos to the comedy troupe Upright Citizens Brigade to a daring gang of jewel thieves, Coyle offers specific strategies that trigger learning, spark collaboration, build trust, and drive positive change. Coyle unearths helpful stories of failure that illustrate what not to do, troubleshoots common pitfalls, and shares advice about reforming a toxic culture.&nbsp;</p> <p>Combining leading-edge science, on-the-ground insights from world-class leaders, and practical ideas for action, <i>The Culture Code</i> offers a roadmap for creating an environment where innovation flourishes, problems get solved, and expectations are exceeded. Culture is not something you are - it’s something you do. <i>The Culture Code</i> puts the power in your hands. No matter the size of your group or your goal, this book can teach you the principles of cultural chemistry that transform individuals into teams that can accomplish amazing things together.</p>";
