Perhaps surprisingly, they do it very differently from the vast majority of tech companies. In <i>Inspired</i>, technology product management thought leader Marty Cagan provides listeners with a master class in how to structure and staff a vibrant and successful product organization and how to discover and deliver technology products that your customers will love - and that will work for your business. </p> <p>With sections on assembling the right people and skillsets, discovering the right product, embracing an effective yet lightweight process, and creating a strong product culture, listeners can take the information they learn and immediately leverage it within their own organizations - dramatically improving their own product efforts. Whether you're an early stage start-up working to get to product/market fit or a growth-stage company working to scale your product organization or a large, long-established company trying to regain your ability to consistently deliver new value for your customers, <i>Inspired</i> will take you and your product organization to a new level of customer engagement, consistent innovation, and business success. </p> <p>Filled with the author's own personal stories - and profiles of some of today's most successful product managers and technology-powered product companies, including Adobe, Apple, BBC, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix - <i>Inspired</i> will show you how to turn up the dial of your own product efforts, creating technology products your customers love. </p> <p>The first edition of <i>Inspired</i>, published 10 years ago, established itself as the primary reference for technology product managers and can be found on the shelves of nearly every successful technology product company worldwide.
