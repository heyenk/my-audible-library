window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>2019 Independent Audiobook Award Winner for Apocalyptica </b></p> <p>Survival can be a lonely existence...or not. The reality of the situation always comes down to a simple decision: What kind of world do you want to build?</p> <p>The survivors have come to settle in the mountains of Wyoming, fighting day in and day out to establish a home for themselves in a near-empty world. Things are good at first; scavenging is a workable, short-term solution that seems to be providing all they need.</p> <p>But they know that it’s only a matter of time before the food runs out. They need to scramble to find a sustainable solution before the clock stops, and for a little handful of people up in the mountains, the odds don’t seem very favorable.</p> <p>Further south, a new band of people migrates across the map, running on fumes and searching desperately for a place to settle. All around them, as resources run thin, the world grows colder and more violent.</p> <p>It’s getting worse out there, always getting worse, and it’s starting to look like survival might just depend on how violent they’re willing to get....</p>";
