window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I have a theory about the \"Hero's Journey\". We all have one. We have many, in fact. But our primary hero's journey is the passage we live out, in real life, <i>before</i> we find our calling. The hero's journey ends when, like Odysseus, we return home to Ithaca, to the place from which we started.</p> <p>What then?</p> <p>The passage that comes next is the \"Artist's Journey\".</p> <p>On our artist's journey, we move past resistance and past self-sabotage. We discover our true selves and our authentic calling, and we produce the works we were born to create.</p> <p>You are an artist too - whether you realize it or not, whether you like it or not - and you have an artist's journey. Will you live it out? Will you follow your muse and do the work you were born to do?</p> <p>Ready or not, you are called.</p>";
