window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare - poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a US Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring <i>Outside</i> magazine to name him The Fittest (Real) Man in America.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Can't Hurt Me</i>, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>An annotated edition of <i>Canâ€™t Hurt Me</i>, offering over two hours of bonus content featuring deeper insights and never-before-told stories shared by David. Not available in other formats.</p>";
