window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Patrick&nbsp;Lencioni&nbsp;unveils a truly groundbreaking new model that will change the way we think about work and teams forever. </b></p> <p><b><i>The 6 Types of Working Genius</i></b><b> is the fastest way to help people identify the type of work that brings them joy and energy, and avoid work that leads to frustration and burnout.</b></p> <p>Beyond the personal discovery and instant relief that Working Genius provides, the model also gives teams a remarkably simple and practical framework for tapping into one another’s natural gifts, which increases productivity and reduces unnecessary judgment.</p> <p>In classic Lencioni fashion, Pat brings his model to life in a thrilling fable that is as relatable as it is compelling. He tells the story of Bull Brooks, an entrepreneur, husband, and father who sets out to solve his own frustration at work and stumbles into a new way of thinking that changes the way he sees his work, his team, and even his marriage.</p> <p>What sets this book—and the model behind it—apart from other tools and assessments is the speed at which it can be understood and applied, and the relevance it has to every kind of work in life, from running a company to launching a product to managing a family.</p> <p>In addition to this book, Lencioni and the Table Group have created a 10-minute assessment that helps individuals quickly identify their gifts and apply this model to themselves and their teams. Join the hundreds of thousands of people who have already discovered their Working Genius, and experience the transformation in your work, your team, and your life.</p>";
